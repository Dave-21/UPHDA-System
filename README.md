## Introduction
Welcome to the **Satellite Detection System**! This project aims to:
- Capture night-sky images using a Raspberry Pi camera.
- Detect satellite streaks and generate partial TLEs.
- Compare detections with known satellite catalogs (e.g., Space-Track, N2YO).
- Upload results to a central server for further analysis and archiving.

## Goals
1. **Automated Observation**  
   - Operate cameras autonomously overnight, triggered by sunset/sunrise or weather conditions.

2. **Accurate Satellite Detection**  
   - Detect streaks via image processing (e.g., Hough transform).
   - Filter out false positives (planes, noise, etc.).

3. **TLE Generation & Comparison**  
   - Convert streak endpoints to RA/Dec using plate-solving.
   - Fit partial orbital elements, compare with official catalogs.

4. **Centralized Data & Reporting**  
   - Aggregate logs and TLE data on a central server.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface to check status and results.
